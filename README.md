# Loan-Default-Prediction
Loan Default Prediction
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project in applied data science. The project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning techniques.

Project Description
In this capstone project, I address the challenge of predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. I leverage a dataset of historical loan data and employ various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to build a predictive model.

Installation Instructions
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Install Python 3.x.
Install Anaconda Navigator.
Clone this repository.
Install required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Usage
To train the model and make predictions, run the Loan_Default_Prediction_Full_Code-ArnetriceSmith.ipynb notebook.

Data Sources
The dataset used in this project can be found at hmeq.csv.

Results
The predictive model achieved an accuracy of 0.89 and identified a 3% improvement in positive return.
